Seon-chaek hails from a wealthy family and at first aspires to a simple, tranquil life, intending to watch the novel\u0027s plot unfold from the sidelines before eventually resuming her own life. But when she meets Lee Beon, the chilly, attractive, and seemingly compulsive male protagonist of the book, by chance while intoxicated, her intentions are utterly upended.  Favoured by the King, Beon is a prince with royal ancestry who excels in martial arts.  He has a tragic history as well. After this unanticipated \u0022first night,\u0022 Beon grows infatuated with Seon-chaek and demands to wed her.  Given that Beon was meant to fall in love with Jo Eun-ae, the original female lead, this completely upends the plot of the original novel. Seon-chaek, still possessed by K, tries desperately to steer Beon back towards Eun-ae and restore the original plot, but no matter how hard she tries, Beon\u0027s affection consistently returns to her.",
